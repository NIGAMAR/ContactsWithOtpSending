TOOLS USED TO BUILD THE APPLICATION
IDE- ANDROID STUDIO
PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE- KOTLIN
ARCHITECTURAL PATTERN- MVVM
EXTERNAL LIBRARIES
• ROOM DATABASE FOR DATA PERSISTENCE
• LIVE DATA AND VIEW MODEL
• NAVIGATION ARCHITECTURE COMPONENTS WITH SAFE ARGS TO HANDLE IN
APP NAVIGATION
• KODEIN FOR DEPENDENCY INJECTION
• KOTLIN COROUTINES FOR ASYNC PROGRAMMING
• THREETENABP FOR DATE TIME SUPPORT
GOOD PRACTICE
THE APP ADOPTS MVVM ARCHITECTURE THAT IS RECOMMENDED BY
GOOGLE. IMPLEMENTING MVVM INCREASES THE SCALABILITY OF THE
APPLICATION. THE APP CONSISTS FOR 3 MAIN PARTS DATA, INTERNAL AND UI. THE
BEST FEATURE OF THE APPLICATION IS THE DATA AND UI ARE LOOSELY COUPLED
USING VIEW MODEL AND REPOSITORY AND ALL DEPENDENCIES ARE PROVIDED BY
THE KODEIN LIBRARY THIS MAKES THE TESTING OF THE COMPONENTS A CAKE
WALK.
FEATURES OF THE APPLICATION
1) CAN HANDLE SCREEN ORIENTATION SMOOTHLY
2) ASKS THE USER FOR PERMISSION BEFORE SENDING OUT THE MESSAGE
3) SEPARATE UI FOR LANDSCAPE AND PORTRAIT MODE
4) MODULAR SINCE ALL FUNCTIONALITY IS IMPLEMENTED THROUGH
FRAGMENTS
